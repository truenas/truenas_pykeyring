Description: C Python bindings for keyutils
 This package provides Python bindings for the Linux kernel keyring service
 via the keyutils library. It allows Python applications to securely store
 and retrieve secrets, keys, and other sensitive data using the kernel's
 built-in keyring facility.
 .
 The keyring service provides a way to cache authentication tokens, encryption
 keys, and other security credentials in kernel memory, making them available
 to processes without storing them in user space files.
